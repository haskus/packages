-- | Implementation of LZ77
--
-- The idea is to use a sliding window to compress and decompress. The window w
-- contains the n last tokens you have (de)compressed. It is initialized with a
-- default element (ini :: a). The size of the window is a parameter.
--
-- You have a sequence of tokens s :: [a] to compress. You seek for the longest
-- proper prefix p of s that is present in (w ++ dropLast p).  The recursive
-- definition allows for multiple repetition of the same pattern. 
-- E.g. w = xxxxx102, s = 1021021023 -> p has length 9 and position (n-3)
--
-- The maximum length of p is parametric. p can't be equal to s, it is a
-- *proper* prefix, meaning that at least the last token of s is not in p.
-- 
-- Each compression step returns a (Code pos len c :: Code a) where pos and len
-- are respectively the position and length of the prefix in the window. "c" is
-- the token just after the prefix in s. When len is 0, only one character
-- of s is encoded. 
--
-- The final result is a sequence of (Code a). It can be later transformed into
-- a new sequence of [a] by encoding positions and lengths into "a" values
-- (e.g. imagine "a" is a byte (Word8)).
--
-- The decompression algorithm is similar. It uses the same kind of window. It
-- decompresses an input s :: [Code a] into a [a].
